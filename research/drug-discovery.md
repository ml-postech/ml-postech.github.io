This research focuses on applying deep learning to the field of scientific discovery. Specifically, we aim to build model architectures tailored to each scientific domain while efficiently incorporating inductive biases, such as geometric priors, to address various scientific challenges. Our work has broad applications in areas such as molecule generation, molecular property prediction and drug-target binding pose estimation.
