Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved time series forecasting, yet many models still struggle with non-stationarity, irregular sampling, and long-term dependency degradation. Our research addresses these challenges by developing robust forecasting frameworks that integrate diffusion-based generative modeling and temporal representation learning. Specifically, we explore how moving average mechanisms and denoising diffusion processes can enhance stability under distributional shifts and missing intervals. Through this approach, we aim to achieve more adaptive and generalizable forecasting models that can accurately predict complex temporal patterns in domains such as energy, transportation, and semiconductor manufacturing.
