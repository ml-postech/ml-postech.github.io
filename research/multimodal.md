Recent advances in AI have enabled robots to perform simple tasks based on language instructions. However, they struggle to handle long-term tasks in complex environments, due to difficulties in integrating visual observations with language instructions, and planning subsequent actions accordingly. In this study, we develop methods leveraging multimodal large language models to help robots interpret their visual surroundings and plan more effectively, ultimately enabling them to perform real-world tasks successfully.
