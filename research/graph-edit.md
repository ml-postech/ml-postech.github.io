Using high-quality data is crucial for training accurate machine learning models. Graph data, which includes structural information in the form of edges, offers unique opportunities for improving model performance. Graph learning enhancement aims to refine this structural information by removing noise and emphasizing more informative patterns. Techniques such as edge rewiring, which modifies connections between nodes, node dropping, which removes less important nodes, and label smoothing, which adjusts labels to reduce overconfidence, all leverage the inherent relationships in the graph to improve model accuracy and generalization.
