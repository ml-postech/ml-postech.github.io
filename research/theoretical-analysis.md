Online learning involves algorithms that make decisions and learn from data sequentially. We aim to develop a solid theoretical foundation to understand and evaluate the performance of these methods. In this project, students will study the core principles of online learning, including performance analysis, regret minimization, and the development of provably efficient algorithms.
