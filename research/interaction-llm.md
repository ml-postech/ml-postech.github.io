People increasingly rely on LLMs in everyday scenarios, asking them a wide range of questions and tasks. However, LLMs often produce incorrect or unintended responses. To obtain the desired outcome, users interact with the model over multiple turns to iteratively refine its output. In this study, we explore ways to enhance the effectiveness of such interactions. For example, we propose in-place feedback, which moves beyond the conventional multi-turn setting by allowing users to directly edit the model’s previous response, leading to more efficient and natural interaction.
