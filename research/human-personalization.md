Recently, we are moving beyond simply making AI systems more powerful and towards making them more human-centered—tailored to individual needs, preferences, and contexts. This requires AI to contextually learn and adapt based on user interaction, actively incorporating implicit user feedback and guidance into its response process. Therefore, we are developing AI that: (1) deeply understands dynamic user needs and contexts, leveraging implicit feedback; (2) exhibits context-aware learning, recognizing preference shifts across situations and adapting accordingly; and (3) provides interpretable personalization parameters, giving users more direct control. Participants in this study will contribute to our ongoing efforts to this development.
