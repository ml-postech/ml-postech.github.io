Recently, foundation models capable of processing diverse data and handling various tasks have emerged. Applying this concept to graphs allows us to envision models that can solve diverse graph types and tasks. However, graphs exhibit vastly different characteristics depending on domains like molecules or citations, making knowledge transfer extremely challenging. This research explores methods for understanding graphs, facilitating knowledge transfer across domains, and leveraging LLMs for graph processing. Ultimately, we aim to develop a foundation model that comprehends diverse graphs and excels at performing all types of graph tasks.
